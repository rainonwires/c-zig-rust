# c-zig-rust

[Warmup](https://www.codewars.com/) prior to coding.

learning c, zig &amp; rust

*Some languages to learn in the future using the same method would be... Fortran, CommonLisp, Lambda calculus, Perl, Pascal*

Order of 'completion' 
1. Zig
2. C
3. Rust

To achieve this completion we will follow a list of projects to create with beginner difficulty, intermediate difficulty & advanced difficulty.

there will be 5 projects in each difficulty.

To simplify this, we will use check boxes as seen below.

- [ ] Start on [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
